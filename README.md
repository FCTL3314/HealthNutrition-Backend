# üìÉ Description

This Django application is designed for **comparing prices between different stores, helping users find the best
deals on various products**. The project provides a **user-friendly interface** to browse products across different
categories and view price variations among stores.

Users can **search for specific products or explore product categories to compare prices and make informed purchasing
decisions**. The application also **allows users to view detailed information about each product**, including store
